# Welcome 👋

### About me
 I am a certified AWS professional with extensive knowledge in web development and with exceptional relationship-building skills from a hospitality background.
 Also I follow closely news about technological trends, product releases and general discourse in the tech space.

 Working as a Cloud Engineer has been a passion of mine. The ever-evolving technology landscape and the constant innovation that takes place in this field are what excite me the most. My ultimate goal is to become an expert in this field and to help organisations realise the full potential of the cloud. 



### Interests

- Cloud and Automation: My goal is to leverage the potential of cloud to benefit all users. ☁
- Motorbikes: Current project is a Jawa 350 from 1984, bringing back to his full shine. 🏍
- Cycling: Taking bike off-road around forests and hills gives me lots of adrenaline. 🚴
- Hiking: Where bikes can't take me, I'll walk or climb. There is no place that can defeat me! 🧗‍♂️
- Paddleboarding: I once voyaged with group of friends across open waters between two islands. 🏄‍♂️
- Software Development: Always open to collaborate on Open Source Projects. 🖥
- RC Models: RC plane models have captured my attention and interest over the past few months. ✈️
- Traveling: I had the opportunity to visit three neighboring capital cities in just three days. 🏝

### Contact
Always open to collaborate on Open Source Projects. Feel free to connect/write to me with your prject ideas. We will take it forward with a coffee talk or a virtual meet! 🤙
